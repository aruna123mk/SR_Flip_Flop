SR flip flop is also the storage element that can store the single data it may be either 1 or 0. The block diagram of the SR flip-flop is shown below, along with its truth table and waveforms.

As shown in the above truth table, whenever the input of SR is 00 the output will not change it remains the same as in the previous state, WHen inputs are 01 the output q gets reset, if the inputs of SR is 10 then the output is gets set and at last combination when both SR inputs are 11 then the output is unpredictable. This whole work is written in the truth table as shown above.
